=> CentOS machine is used in this project

=> Login as root in the host server that contains puppet agent

=> Install the garethr-docker module using this command in the host machine from the forge
-> puppet module install garethr-docker

=> Create the directory src/puppet/modules/docker_demo
-> mkdir -p src/puppet/modules/docker_demo

=> change to the directory created above and create a puppet manifest to install docker
-> vi install.pp 
-> class { 'docker':
	dns => '8.8.8.8',
    }

The above manifest customizes the docker deployment with a custom DNS server.

=> Run the puppet parser validate on the install.pp file to check for any errors 
-> puppet parser validate install.pp

=> Run puppet apply 
-> puppet apply install.pp

=> We are now ready to work with docker, let's start by downloading an image. Create a file image_pull.pp in the same directory

-> docker::image { 'ubuntu':
	ensure     => 'present',
	image_tag  => 'trusty'
    }

=> Run the puppet parser validate on image_pull.pp and if it has no erros run puppet apply to download the ubuntu image
-> puppet apply image_pull.pp 

=> If the command is succesfull, we will be having ubuntu image in our machine. Run this command to check the images in the system
-> docker images

=> create a file in the same directory "run_container.pp" 
=> since we have downloaded the image, we can spin up the container
-> docker::run { 'container':
	ensure   => 'present',
	image    => 'ubuntu',
	command  => 'bin/sh -c "while true; do echo test container sleep 1; done';,
    }

-> puppet parser validate run_container.pp
-> puppet apply run_container.pp

=> To check the container that we created
-> docker ps -a

=> To remove the container, create a new file "remove_container.pp"
-> docker::run { 'run_container':
	ensure   => 'absent',
	image    => 'ubuntu',
	command  => 'bin/sh -c "while true; do echo test container sleep 1; done";,
    }

-> puppet parser validate remove_container.pp
-> puppet apply remove_container.pp
